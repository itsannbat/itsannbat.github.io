      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">I am a current rising senior at the UW Paul Allen School with a deep passion for computer science and a particular fascination with the world of data science. My journey in this field has led me to explore both backend and frontend development, allowing me to gain a comprehensive understanding of software engineering.
        Beyond coding and problem-solving, I enjoy hiking, reading and playing video games.</p>
